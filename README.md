## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Media query


### What I learned

I learnt that coding is simply not for the weak. Most importantly I feel am getting a hang of media queries and also box shadow style
To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.card-container:hover {
    box-shadow:
    0px 1px 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15),
    1px 2px 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15),
    2px 4px 8px 16px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15),
    4px 8px 16px 32px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);
}



### Continued development

I will make sure I understand media query more and explore new css codes that i have not encountered.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_borders.asp) - This helped me for understanding how border radius works. I have understood how to write border radius for all sides in one line.
